## Ingredients

* 2 large eggplants, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
* 1 1/2 cups whole-wheat breadcrumbs
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/2 cups marinara sauce
* 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a shallow dish, whisk together the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper. In another shallow dish, combine the whole-wheat breadcrumbs with grated Parmesan cheese.
3. Dip the eggplant slices into the egg mixture, then coat them with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to help the breadcrumbs stick.
4. Arrange the breaded eggplant slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Brush each slice with olive oil.
5. Bake the eggplant for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and tender.
6. In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of marinara sauce. Arrange a layer of the cooked eggplant slices on top of the sauce, then top with more marinara sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.
7. Repeat layering until all the eggplant slices are used up, ending with a layer of marinara sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese on top.
8. Bake the Eggplant Parmesan for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
9. Let the Eggplant Parmesan cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with chopped fresh basil or parsley, if desired.
